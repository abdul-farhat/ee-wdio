# Equal Experts: Javascript technical face-to-face 

## Solved by: Abdul Samad Farhat

## Pre-requisites
Candidates should have the following installed:
- An up to date version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/).  We suggest using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage node/npm.
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Windows users
If you are planning on running this test in native Windows then you can follow instructions found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows). You can also run the tests in WSL but unfortunately we can't provide instructions on how to set this up.

## Starting the Application
Execute `./run.sh` from the project root.  If you are using Windows then run `.\run.bat`.  The service can be reached via a browser [here](http://localhost:3000/)

## Getting Started
Download all project specific packages with: `npm install`

## Running the tests
To run the tests execute: `npm test`

## Tasks to complete
Assume that this is an existing test framework within a company that leans heavily on [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro). You are required to complete the **three** tasks described below to the best your abilities.  We ask that you take a couple of hours to complete the exercise, but feel free to take a little more time if necessary.  Your code should be well-structured and easy to follow.  Don't forget to include assertions.

When you review the project you will find:
* `shop-spec.js` which contains a basic template for the below three tasks. 
* `customer.js` which is a basic Customer object to represent a user.

The project is already set up with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite) and [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/example). You can add and use any additional libraries that you require to complete the tasks.

### Things we expect to see
* Tests that run **successfully** out of the box.
* Be sure to include assertions in the tests.
* Clean code
* Well commented code if required (i.e. you made fundamental changes to the framework in some way).

### Task 1: Create customer
Start the JuiceShop application and access it via a browser.  Manually register a user taking note of the email and password values you provide.  Record those value in the Customer object in the setup function of the `Juice Shop Homepage` spec.

_Note: the application only persists users in memory.  If the container dies you will need to repeat this step to get your tests passing._

### Task 2: UI test
Using the credentials you recorded in Task 1, automate the Review Posting journey (Login is provided) via the UI.  Don't forget to assert that your review appears on the appropriate screen.

### Task 3: API test
Using the credentials you recorded in Task 1, automate the Juice Shop Login (to get a authentication token) and Review Posting journeys via the API.  We've provided some [API documentation](JuiceShopApiReference.md) to help.

## Ways to submit your solution
The solution you submit should:
* Include the original code that we sent you.
* Not include the dependencies downloaded by `npm`.
* Include your solution to the tasks.
* Any instructions/comments that you would like to include. If you do include any additional documentation please make us aware of it so it doesn't get missed. For example, it could be worth mentioning if you have built a solution that runs on Windows or requires a specific version of Java. 

### Method 1
Push your solution to a private repository on Github or Gitlab and give access to the following email addresses:
* lim.sim@equalexperts.com
* adrian.rapan@equalexperts.com
* dan.prokopiwskyi@equalexperts.com

### Method 2
Zip up your solution and email it to the EE People Team that you are in contact with.

Do remember to check that you included/excluded the things mentioned above when you are zipping up your solution.
